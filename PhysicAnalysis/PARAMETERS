--------

Save_Cotrol_Histograms_bool
--- Common for each module, if set to true, in the output ROOT files folder with
statistics will contain control histograms. Set to false if histograms not needed.

TimeWindowCreator_MainStrip_int
--- Dedicated for files with data from measurement with Reference Detector - it
denotes which ID has the reference scintillator. If option not set, part with reference
detector is ignored

TimeWindowCreator_MinTime_float
--- Time Slots have certain duration for specific runs, minimum time is usually
negative, default value -1*10^6 ps

TimeWindowCreator_MaxTime_float
--- default value 0.0 ps

TimeCalibLoader_ConfigFile_std::string
--- name of ASCII file of required structure, containing time calibrations,
specific for each run

SignalFinder_EdgeMaxTime_float
--- time window for matching Signal Channels on Leading Edge.
Default value: 5 000 ps.

SignalFinder_LeadTrailMaxTime_float
--- time window for matching Signal Channels on the same thresholds from
Leading and Trailing edge. Default value: 25 000 ps.

HitFinder_VelocityFile_std::string
--- name of ASCII file of required format, containing values of effective velocities
of light in each scintillator.

HitFinder_ABTimeDiff_float
--- time window for matching Signals on the same scintillator and different sides
Default value: 6 000 ps.

HitFinder_RefDetScinID_int
--- ID of Reference Detector Scintillator, needed for creating reference hits.

EventFinder_EventTime_float
--- time window for grouping hits in one event. Default value 5 000 ps.

EventFinder_MinEventMultiplicity_int
--- events of minimum multiplicity will only be saved in output file. Default
value is 1, so all events are saved.

Scatter_Categorizer_TOF_TimeDiff_float
--- categorizer tool for recognizing scatterings. User can constrain allowed discrepancy
between calculated time of flight of scatter candidate and difference of two hit times.

Back2Back_Categorizer_SlotThetaDiff_float
--- denotes acceptable difference in degrees between opposite slots, to categorize
two hits as back-to-back type. Default value is 3.0 degrees, so accepted slot theta
difference will be between 177.0 and 183.0 degrees.

Deex_Categorizer_TOT_Cut_Min_float
--- denotes Time over Threshold cut minimal value for simple selection of deexcitation photons
Default value: 30 000 ps.

Deex_Categorizer_TOT_Cut_Max_float
--- denotes Time over Threshold cut maximal value for simple selection of deexcitation photons
Default value: 50 000 ps.
