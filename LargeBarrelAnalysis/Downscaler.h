/**
 * @brief User Task filtering JPetEvent-s according to downscaling rules
 *
 * This task acts as a simple filter on a steam of JPetEvent objects.
 * Its operation is controlled by user options speficying separate
 * "downscaling factors" for each multiplicity of hits in an event.
 * Each kind of events (1-hit, 2-hit, 3-hit events etc.) is either
 * passed on entirely (if factor=100%) or downscaled (factor < 100%)
 * in order to reduce the volume of the files occupied by events
 * for which the full statistics from the data is not needed.
