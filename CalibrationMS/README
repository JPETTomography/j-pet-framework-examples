Aim
---
This example is created for time calibration and synchronization of the whole detection system based on the measurements performed with a radioactive source and a reference detector.

Expected output
---------------
No output to stdout.
JPet.log file appears with the log of the processing and ROOT files with the following etensions are produced:
 *.tslot.raw.root
 *.tslot.calib.root
 *.raw.sig.root
 *.phys.sig.root
 *.hits.root
 *.calib.root

where "*" stands for the name of the input file

Input Data
-----------
For this example, user must provide data file(s) collected with the big barrel for the measurements performed with a radioactive source and a reference detector. For the purpose of calibration data files names should be following: LayerX_SlotY.hld, where X and Y correspond to irradiated Slot in proper layer. 

Description
--------------
The analysis is split into tasks.


Additional info
--------------

The filtering of signals is added in the TimeWindowCreator module -> only signals from the irradiated strip are processed further. In order to use it, one must add the following parameter to user options (e.g. in userParams.json):
"TimeWindowCreator_MainStrip":"XXX"
where XXX are the coordinates of the irradiated strip encded as a single integer number in the following way:
layer number * 100 + slot number
e.g. for processing data from reference detector at slot 43 in layer 2 XXX=243 

Compiling 
------------
make

Running
------------
The script run.sh contains an example of running the analysis (for RUN1).
