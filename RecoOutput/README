This example reuses LargeBarrelExtended example and shows how to prepare output for 3D hybrid reconstruction frm the J-PET big barrel. 

Expected output
---------------
No output to stdout.
JPet.log file appears with the log of the processing and ROOT files with the following etensions are produced:
 *.tslot.raw.root
 *.tslot.calib.root
 *.raw.sig.root
 *.phys.sig.root
 *.hit.root
 *.unk.evt.root
 *.cat.evt.root
 output.txt

where "*" stands for the name of the input file and "output.txt" contains data needed for reconstruction in form of
X,Y,Z,T coordinates for both hits from LOR line.

Input Data
-----------
For this example, user must provide their own data file(s) collected with the big barrel. Please note, that
reconstruction does not cope well with data containing a lot of noise from scattered events and they should be
suppressed.

Description
--------------
The analysis is split into tasks as in LargeBarrelAnalysis. Last module in analysis chain goes through all events and
selects those which contain only two hits and outputs their space and time coordinates into output.txt file.

Additional info
--------------
To use data from this example in analysis one has to use 3dconvert tool and run reconstruction as specified in reports
XXX.

Compiling 
------------
make

Running
------------
The script run.sh contains an example of running the analysis. Note, however, that
the user must fill the input data file name and the number of run
