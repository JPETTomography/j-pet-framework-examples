This example show a simple procedure of Imaging, for data collected by the Big Barrel. 

Expected output
---------------
No output to stdout.
JPet.log file appears with the log of the processing and ROOT files with the following etensions are produced:
 *.tslot.raw.root
 *.tslot.calib.root
 *.raw.sig.root
 *.phys.sig.root
 *.hit.root
 *.unk.evt.root
 *.cat.evt.root

where "*" stands for the name of the input file

Input Data
-----------
For this example, user must provide their own data file(s) collected with the big barrel.

Description
--------------
Procedure uses a couple of constants that is used for process of selection of hits

userParams option:

 "TimeCalibLoader_ConfigFile_std::string":"[file]", 			File with time calibration constants;
 "SignalFinder_EdgeMaxTime_float":"4000",				Time Window for Leading edges to gather impulses into one signal
 "SignalFinder_LeadTrailMaxTime_float":"30000",				Time Window for Trailing and Leading times on the same threshold to gather them into presignal
 "HitFinder_TimeWindowWidth_float":"25000",				Time Window for signals on both sides of photomultiplier to gather them into Hit
 "EventFinder_EventTime_float":"200000",				Time Window for Hits to gather them into Event
 "EventFinder_MinimalEventSize_int":"1",				Minimal Size of Event to Save it for Categorization
 "EventCategorizer_MinAnnihilationTOT_float":"10000",			Minimal TOT of Hit to analyze it further as Annihilation Hit
 "EventCategorizer_MaxAnnihilationTOT_float":"25000",			Maximal TOT of Hit to analyze it further as Annihilation Hit
