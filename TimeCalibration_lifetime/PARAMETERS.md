Save_Control_Histograms_bool
--- Common for each module, if set to true, in the output ROOT files folder with
statistics will contain control histograms. Set to false if histograms not needed.

StopIteration_bool
--- A flag indicating, that the module is called in the iterative mode with number of iterations defined in
main.cpp as the last argument (true) or with user-defined condition to exit the loop (false). In the latter case
one needs to put -1 as the last argument of manager.useTask (see the description of the TimeCalibration_NiterMax_int)

TimeWindowCreator_MainStrip_int
--- Dedicated for files with data from measurement with Reference Detector:

This means that signals from any other strips will be ignored at the lowest possible level,
resulting in much faster processing. For more detailes please read README

--- Value used for finding the first estimation of the extremum on the derivatives. If it is too high, Calibrate.exe would
show for many modules that the threshold is too high. If it is too low, extremum estimates will be wrongly estimated.
--- Default value: 6

Effective_Length_float
--- Value of the effective length that are used to estimate velocity of every module. It can be changed and different PALS

--- Number of files that are used for the effective length scan. Every file should ocrrespond to different effective length value
for which calibration was done. It is used to scan the effLenParams.json file in order to find every file and length. 
If the number will be equal to 3, EstimateEffectiveLength.exe will look for options:
File_1_std::string
File_2_std::string
File_3_std::string
Length_1_float
Length_2_float
Length_3_float
if it will be equal to 2:
File_1_std::string
File_2_std::string
Length_1_float
Length_2_float
so the number of options are fluent and can change with different number of files

Length_%d_float option. %d should be equal to the number of a given file, for example: File_1_std::string

for example: Length_1_float

Reference_file_ID_int
--- number of a %d in above options that should be used as a reference file, from which mean correction difference
will be calculated. It should no change the results with different number, but it should be lower than the maximal %d
for which File_%d_std::string and Length_%d_float is given

Output_root_file_std::string
--- Name of a `ROOT` file that will contain results from the estimation of the effective length.
