This is an example of creating one's own analysis based on the "LargeBarrelAnalysisExample".
You can start your own analysis by copying the "NewAnalysisTemplate" directory.

Starting you own Analysis
-------------------------

When starting you own analysis, do not edit any of the existing examples as this will lead to problems with Git-based version control. Instead, follow this procedure:

1. Copy the "NewAnalysisTemplate" directory to a name you wish to give to you analysis. Let us use "MyAnalysis" as an example:
    cp -r NewAnalysisTemplate MyAnalysis

2. Add the following line at the end of the j-pet-framework-examples/CMakeLists.txt:
    add_subdirectory(MyAnalysis)
(replace MyAnalysis with whichever name you gave to your directory)

3. Edit the file CMakeLists.txt located in you new directory, e.g. MyAnalysis/CMakeLists.txt and and in the following line:
    set(projectName NewProjectName)
replace NewProjectName with your project name, e.g. MyAnalysis

4. Furter in the CMakeLists.txt file, you will see lines responsible for using modules from the "LargeBarrelAnalysis" example. In case you want to customize any of the modules, copy this module's .h and .cpp files to your directory and comment out the lines concerning this module.

5. Now when you follow the standard procedure to configure and build all of the J-PET framework examples, a directory with the name you chose will be created in your build directory, e.g. build/MyAnalysis and will contain an executable with the name you chose for the project, e.g. MyAnalysis.x.

Additional Info
---------------
Note that the "TimeCalibration" and "VelocityCalibration" examples follow exactly the above scheme of being based on "LargeBarrelAnalysis" and its modules, so you can refer to these examples for advanced usage of the template decribed here.
