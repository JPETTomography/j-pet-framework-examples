Aim
---
This is a program for producing input needed for effective velocity calculation from measurements with collimator

Expected output
---------------
Since it is based on LargeBarrelAnalysis example file extensions from framework will be the same.
Additionally  output files containing time difference spectra, in PNG format,
 based on harcoded <int> in file TaskDVelocity.cpp in line 64 will be created with in:
Results/position_<int>/*.png

In workidir a result.txt file will be created with results needed for calculations in format:
| slot | <int> | threshold label | gaus mean | gaus mean error | chi2 | NDF | 

each line contains result for each slot and each threshold label.
The file will be updated after analysing file from each irradiation position.

Input Data
-----------
User must provide their own data file(s) collected with the big barrel, with collimator.
For each file one has to manually write down position in TaskDVelocity.cpp in line 64.

Description
--------------
The analysis has the same modules A - C as LargeBarrelAnalysis, in module D two modifications are added: gaussian fitting  and output to file "results.txt".
One has recompile the program and start it manually for each datafile. After all files have been analysed "results.txt" is used by standalone program called


Additional info
--------------

Compiling 
------------
make

Running
------------
The script run.sh contains an example of running the analysis. Note, however, that
the user must fill the input data file name and the number of run
