# Image Reconstruction

## Aim
This example contains several image reconstruction modules that allows user to quick cross-check the data or generate a sinogram for future reconstruction.

## Expected output
No output to stdout.
`JPet_**.log` file appears with the log of the processing and ROOT files with the following extensions are produced:  
`*.reco`  
`*.sino`  
For SinogramCreator module also the additional file is created with name, that is set by user option:  
`SinogramCreator_OutFileName_std::string`  
(default: `sinogram.ppm`)

## Input Data
Imput data should be `*.unk.evt` file generated by another module (eg. from `LargeBarrelAnalysis` example)

## Description
The analysis is split into tasks.

## Compiling
`make`

## Running
The script `run.sh` contains an example of running the analysis. Note, however, that the user must fill the input data file name and the number of the run.
